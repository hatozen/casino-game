This is a simple C++ betting game application in which a user can upload an amount to the balance,
bet an amount, and guess a number between 1 - 10 that will be compared to the randomly generated 
winning number. 

  If user # matches winning #, user will win 10x the amount he/she bet. 
  If user # does not match with winning #, user will lose the amount he/she bet.
